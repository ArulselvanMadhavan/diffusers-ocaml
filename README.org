* Diffusers-OCaml: A Diffusers API in OCaml

This work is a port of the diffusers-rs library written in Rust. 

** Stable-Diffusion
*** How to run?
    - Download weights and save it data directory. For instructions
      on how to do this, refer [difffusers-rs-docs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/diffusers-rs#converting-the-original-weight-files)
    - Once you have ".ot" files, you are ready to run stable
      diffusion
    - I have found that placing unet and clip on GPU, and placing vae
      on cpu works the best for my GPU. Here is the command that does that. 
      #+begin_src bash
dune exec stable_diffusion -- generate "lighthouse at dark" "vae" "data/pytorch_model.ot" "data/vae.ot" "data/unet.ot"
      #+end_src
    - To run all models in CPU
#+begin_src bash
dune exec stable_diffusion -- generate "lighthouse at dark" "all" "data/pytorch_model.ot" "data/vae.ot" "data/unet.ot"
#+end_src
    - To generate more than 1 sample, use the num_samples parameter
      #+begin_src bash
dune exec stable_diffusion -- generate "lighthouse at dark" "all" "data/pytorch_model.ot" "data/vae.ot" "data/unet.ot" --num_samples=2
      #+end_src

*** Performance
On 8GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Mobile GPU, it takes about 27 seconds to
generate an image. Measurements were done on a 12 CPU Intel(R)
Core(TM) i7-8700K CPU @ 3.70GHz. Running all the steps in CPU takes
little more than three minutes.
```bash
real    0m25.110s
user    0m39.271s
sys     0m11.518s
```
